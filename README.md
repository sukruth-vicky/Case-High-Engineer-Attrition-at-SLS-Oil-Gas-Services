Case Study: High Engineer Attrition at SLS Oil & Gas Services

üìå Overview
This project analyzes the problem of high attrition among Field Engineers (FEs) at SLS Oil & Gas Services, focusing on the Mumbai office where attrition reached 28% in 2016.  
It follows a consulting-style framework (similar to Bain/BCG final-round cases) and combines qualitative and quantitative insights.

üõë Problem Statement
SLS is one of the world‚Äôs largest oil and gas service providers.  
The CEO is concerned about rising attrition among Field Engineers (FEs) in Mumbai.  
The objective: Identify root causes and propose actionable solutions that can be scaled globally.

üîç Analysis

Qualitative Findings
- Work-life imbalance: long offshore stints, poor living conditions.
- Career stagnation: no transfers out, weak growth path.
- Overworked seniors and underutilized juniors.
- Declining compensation competitiveness vs. peers.
- Start-up culture and alternative career paths pulling engineers away.

Quantitative Findings (Calculation)
- Current State (2016): 
  - 50 FEs in total.  
  - Utilization = 80% ‚Üí 40 at work.  
  - Effective Utilization = 60% ‚Üí 30 offshore.  
  - ‚Üí 10 in office (idle), 10 on vacation.  

- Optimized State:
  - 25 standby + 9 active offshore = 34 offshore.  
  - Only 2 needed in office.  
  - ‚Üí 36 working, 14 on vacation.  
  - Effective Utilization rises from 60% ‚Üí 68%.  

Insight: More balanced rotations improve efficiency, increase vacation days, and reduce burnout.

üí° Recommendations

Short-term
- Redesign staffing rotation to 3-week swaps.  
- Improve offshore conditions (food, recreation, internet).  
- Allow more vacations by reducing idle office time.  
- Train managers to be process-driven in staffing decisions.  
- Strengthen team bonding among new and old hires.  

Long-term
- Reinstate transfer opportunities and short-term global stints.  
- Adjust compensation to remain competitive.  
- Recruit candidates aligned with SLS‚Äôs culture.  
- Promote SLS‚Äôs lifestyle (global travel, high responsibility early).  
- Hire slightly more engineers for flexibility.  

‚úÖ Key Takeaways
- Attrition at SLS is mainly driven by internal inefficiencies rather than just external opportunities.  
- A better staffing model and career growth paths can reduce attrition significantly.  
- The Mumbai solution can serve as a global blueprint for SLS.
